<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>
Water Body Clinic is an environmental initiative that focuses on the health and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. We are a multidisciplinary team of scientists, developers, environmentalists, and community mobilizers who collaborate to identify, diagnose, and treat water-related ecological challenges.
</p>
<p>
The initiative was inspired by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 14 — <strong>Life Below Water</strong> — which aims to conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.
